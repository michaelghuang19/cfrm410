Suppose the pdf of X, the distance travelled by a shared electric scooter in a specific neighborhood, in km, is given by  
\[f(t)=\begin{cases}at+bt^2& 0<t<1\\0& \text{otherwise,}  \end{cases}\]
with expectation $\rm E(X)=\frac 6{10} km$

\subsection*{(a)}
Find the constants $a$ and $b$. \\ 
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{831600 outcomes}}

\subsection*{(b)}
What is the probability that the distance travelled by the  scooter is at most $\frac34$ km?

\subsection*{(c)}
Calculate the variance of the distance travelled.

For parts (a) and (b), state what probability distribution you are using, including the parameters of the model.
If  a problem involves using the binomial distribution, and you are thinking of estimating the answer using either the Normal distribution or the Poisson distribution, you must use the only distribution that gives the {\bf{correct}} approximation and not both. Also explain your choice of the distribution, and if there are any assumptions made. 

\subsection*{(a)}
When considering buying a newborn dalmatian, one needs to be aware of incidence of deafness of this particular breed which is a trait that can be passed along to the offspring.  It is said that approximately 30\% of dalmatians are born with deafness. Over the past 10 years, out of 200 dalmatians born in a dog kennel named Seattle puppy house, 70 were born with deafness. Should  Seattle puppy house be worried about their breeding reputation? That is, find the probability that in 200 births, less than 70 will have been born with this trait. Hint: assume one dog's hearing ability is independent of other dogs' hearing ability.

\subsection*{(b)}
Eurostar trains to France arrive at London St Pancras station at a rate of $0.6$ trains per  hour. If $X$ is the inter-arrival train time (the time between a train arrival and the next one), find the probability density function of the log inter-arrival time. That is, find the pdf of $Y=\log(X).$

\subsection*{(c)}
Suppose $X$ is Binomial with parameter $(a,p)$ and $Y$ is Binomial with parameter $(b,p)$, and that X and Y are independent, prove analytically (mathematically) that  $Z=X+Y$ is also Binomial with parameter $(a+b,p).$ You may find this useful: $\sum_{i=0}^{n}\,{{ m}\choose{n- i}}{ p\choose i } = {{m+p}\choose n}$

{\Large 

Given that $X,Y\text{ and } Z$ are all normally distributed with mean $0,0,\text{ and } 2$ respectively and variance $1,2,\text{ and } 9$ respectively.

\subsection*{(a)}
if $\rho_{X,Z}=\frac13$ what is $\rm {Var} (X+Z)?$ 

\subsection*{(b)}
Suppose the r.v. $Y$ is independent from the r.v. $Y+Z$. Find the covariance of $Z$ and $Y.$

\subsection*{(a)}
A chemistry class contains twenty children; 10 are boys and 10 are girls. For an upcoming experiment, the children are arranged into 10 pairs of 2 children each.  If $ N$ is the number of pairs that consist of a boy and a girl, what is the expected value and the variance of $N$? 

\subsection*{(b)}
Student grades for a history exam are independent random variables each with the same probability density function (pdf)
\[f(t)=\begin{cases}4t^{-5}& 1<t<\infty\\ 0& \text{otherwise.}  \end{cases}\]
Here, $t$ represents the grade of a student.  Say four students  take  the history exam. What is the cdf and pdf  of the {\bf{maximum}} of the four students grades. Hint: Let $G_i$ be student $i$'s grade, then the  $G_i$'s are iid random variables each with pdf $f(t)$.
