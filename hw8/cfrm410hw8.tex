Choose a number $X$ at random from the set of numbers
$\left\{ 1,2,3,4,5\right\} $. Now choose a number $Y$ at random
from the set $\left\{ 1,\dots,X\right\} $.

\subsection*{(a)}
Find the joint pmf of $X$ and $Y$. Hint: think of how  joint pmf  is connected to conditional pmf of $Y$ given $X$.

\subsection*{(b)}
Find the conditional mass function of $X$ given that $Y=i$,
for $i=1,2,3,4,5$. That is, find the pmf of $X|_{Y=i}$. 

\subsection*{(c)}
Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

The county hospital is located at the center of a square
whose sides are $3$ miles wide. If an accident occurs within this
square, then the hospital sends out an ambulance. The road network
is rectangular, so the travel distance from the hospital, whose coordinates
are $(0,0)$, to the point $(x,y)$ is $|x|+|y|$. If an accident
occurs at a point that is uniformly distributed in the square, find
the expected travel distance of the ambulance.

{\Large 

There are 3 distinct types of coupons. Independently
of past types collected, each new one is obtained with the following
probabilities: $1/2$ for type $1$, $1/3$ for type $2$, and $1/6$
for type $3$. Let $X$ be the number of different types of coupons
that appear among the first $n$ collected. Find the expected value
and variance of $X$.

\section*{4.}
{\Large 
The following are general questions about covariance and
correlation.

\subsection*{(a)}
Let $X\sim{\rm Bin}\left(n,p\right)$ and $Y\sim G\left(q\right)$
be random variables ($p,q\in\left(0,1\right)$). Is it possible that
$\left|\rho_{X,Y}\right|=1$?

\subsection*{(b)}
Let $X$ be a random variable. Is it possible that $\rho_{X,X^{2}}=1$
for some $X$? What about $\rho_{X,X^{2}}=-1$?

\subsection*{(c)}
Let $X,Y$ be random variables with the following joint
distribution (with $R>0$)
\[
f_{X,Y}\left(x,y\right)=\begin{cases}
c & \,x^{2}+y^{2}\le R;\\
0 & \,\mbox{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
Show that $X,Y$ are uncorrelated, but that they are not independent.
